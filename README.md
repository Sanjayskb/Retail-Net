<br/>
**INTRODUCTION** <br/>
**Problem Summary**<br/>
•	All of the supply chain market trades currently involve a lot of paperwork and they have to wait longer for even normal orders. So it is a very time consuming and tedious task. We therefore decided to develop Retail Net, a system for such networks. The system we have developed is specifically for one particular and can be extended to its multiple branches.<br/>
**Project Introduction**<br/>
•	E-commerce is an online selling network. This effective way of buying allows the customer to create a bulk order online, this, therefore, cuts out the hassle and is a quicker and easier transaction. Meaning you doesn’t even need reps to sell your product.<br/>	
•	“Retail Net” is a web application that provides interacting medium between entities like Manufactures, Whole-sellers, Distributors and Retailers.<br/>
•	“Retail Net” is not for common users. This is a web application that provides service to business related entities.<br/>
•	Using this system entity’s can manage the task of getting the resources or raw materials or product from other entities.<br/>
•	It is a cost and time efficient E-commerce web application which provides the communicating medium between the above mentioned entities.<br/>
•	Details of product will be visible to each entity according to their requirements. Invoice will be generated  which can reduce paper work and time<br/>

**Purpose**<br/>
•	The main purpose of using “Retail Net” is that it benefits the business and the customer. The wholesaler can reduce their prices of the products that they sell which will allow the consumer to purchase more stock at a more suitable price. The wholesaler can sell more products at a reduced price but will gain profit from this as it benefits both parties.<br/>
•	Also it cuts out the unwanted wasted time. Without the e-commerce application wholesalers and consumers or any other entity used a paperback catalogue, this wastes time that companies can’t afford. An advantage of using this web application is that it saves time and fuss of visiting the other entities.<br/>
**Milestones & Deliverables**<br/>
•As the Spiral approach of software development is followed the milestones and deliverables are dynamically decided.<br/>
•Each primary module completion is a milestone.<br/>
•Each primary module consists of various secondary modules that are also considered as milestones.<br/>
•Spiral approach specifies development of a prototype after each iteration of the spiral.<br/>
•Until and unless the product satisfies the user need the spiral iterations are increased and so are the prototypes.<br/>

**Problem Specification**<br/>

**Technology Used for Building Project:Java 11.0**<br/>
	
Java is a general purpose programming language with a number of features that make the language well suited for use on the World Wide Web. Small Java applications are called Java applets and can be downloaded from a Web server and run on your computer by a Java compatible Web browser.<br/>
Java source code files (files with a .java extension) are compiled into a format called byte code (files with a .class extension), which can then be executed by a Java interpreter. Compiled Java code can run on most computers because Java interpreters and runtime environments, known as Java Virtual Machines (JVMs).<br/>

**Literature Review and Prior Art Search**<br/>
Below is the list of websites that are been referred so far.<br/>
•	https://www.alibaba.com/
•	https://my.indiamart.com/
•	https://www.amazon.com/
•	https://www.ebay.com/
•	https://www.target.com/
•	https://www.walmart.com/<br/>
We started our literature review on the basis of the analysis that we have done on meeting our entities such as Retailers, Manufacturers, Wholesalers’ and Distributors. They all were working on the old systems where they use their template and send their agents to get the orders and after getting orders they use to deliver the product. On the other side of selling the product online on such E-Commerce sites like Amazon , Flipkart
, Snapdeal etc, the customers are ordering their items online. So we thought that why not our entities should get the same service as their customers are obtaining from the E-commerce sites. So we thought to provide an online interface to our entities so that they also can order and sell their resources and create an online medium of their trade and business and further providing features such as creating Online Invoice for faster transactions, Product Updation etc.<br/>
We can create a web application that can perform such tasks. Then we searched some of patents on google which can help us in our system.<br/>

1.	Patent No- US20040034578A1 <br/>

Accordingly, a better system is disclosed for storing and maintaining a plurality of field orders and a corresponding plurality of invoices.

<br/>
**Advantages of spiral model**<br/>
•	High amount of risk analysis hence, avoidance of Risk is enhanced.
•	Good for large and mission-critical projects.
•	Strong approval and documentation control.
•	Additional Functionality can be added at a later date.<br/>
**Disadvantages of spiral model**<br/>
•	Can be a costly model to use.
•	Risk analysis requires highly specific expertise.
•	Project’s success is highly dependent on the risk analysis phase.
•	Doesn’t work well for smaller projects.<br/>
**When to use spiral model**<br/>
•	When costs and risk evaluation is important.
•	For medium to high-risk projects.
•	Long-term project commitment unwise because of potential changes to economic priorities.
•	Users are unsure of their needs.
•	Requirements are complex.
•	New product line.
•	Significant changes are expected (research and exploration).
<br/>
**Design Analysis**<br/>
The design analysis of The Retail Net is carried out to reduce the need of physical prototyping and testing. The system design is developed so that the project is better understood. The Finite Element Analysis (FEA: Design Analysis employs the finite element analysis (FEA) method to simulate physical behavior of a product design. The FEA process consists of subdividing all systems into individual components or "elements" whose behavior is easily understood and then reconstructing the original system from these components. This is a natural way of performing analysis in engineering and even in other analytical fields, such as economics. For example in real life the mechanism of the supply chain management is to be analyzed and further the methods that can be implemented on the online bases of real world scenario can be done. this will make the task faster and simpler.<br/>
**Implementation Strategy**<br/>
The following implementation strategy will be followed for The Retail Net.
•	Pre Evaluation Screening: A screening process is carried out to evaluate the system design.
•	Evaluation: A thorough evaluation of the system design is carried out.
•	Project Plan: Complete project for the Retail Net is developed.
•	Gap Analysis: The Gap Analysis of the Retail Net is to decide where the project is right now and where it is supposed to go.
•	Configuration: The process of customizing the design according to the environment of the user.
•	Testing: The testing of system design is important in order to successfully implement the system.
•	Actual Implementation: The system is actually implemented in the environment and ready to be used by the users
•	Post Implementation Maintenance and Monitoring: After the system is implemented it is monitored for feedback and necessary changes are done.<br/>

**Story Boarding**<br/>
**Happy:** <br/>
Mayank had a small store so he had limited reach to the distributor of the product but by using our wed-application he can have access to any of the distributor from anywhere <br/>
**Happy:** <br/>
Suresh had newly opened his shop and has certified GST no. after using this web-application and Registering into it he can easily know the product details that price and from where he can get in low price and more quantities.<br/>
**Sad:** <br/>
Keshav is a employee in a manufacturing company his job is to look at the details of the product. His job is very hectic as he had to manage too much of paper work<br/>
**Sad:** <br/>
Ramesh is a distributor his job is very much important he had to go to the store or company to see or get the product details, it wastes lot of time and money. <br/>

**IMPLEMENTATION**<br/>
**Implementation Environment**<br/>

The Retail Net is implemented over the Internet for users all across the country. India consists of various religions, castes, creeds, color, etc.
<br/>
 The aim of implementation is to respect and honor those. As the Retail Net is a strictly English Language website, regional languages are forbidden. 
<br/>
The user must have to follow a BNBR (Be Nice-Be Respectful) policy of the Retail Net. 
<br/>
The Retail Net has a large user base from all age categories, thus the implementation environment is a wholesome package.<br/>
